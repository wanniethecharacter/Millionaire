		This is the README file of The Helpless Gooses' Millionare game.

		This game is developed by Gellért Sztankovszky based on a team work 
		week of the Helpless Gooses Team.
		The aim of this development is self-entertainment and learning 
		python/programming.

		What is it?

		It's a game based on the TV show "Who wants to be a Millionaire?".
		You will get 15 questions in a random order, and you have to choose the 
		correct answer out of 4.

		How it works / instrucitons:

		You have to type for every question: a / b / c / d

		You have 3 kinds of helps:
			Audience'help
			Telephone help
			Halving the questions by the computer
		
		If you choose an incorrect answer you will instantly lose the game.

		The money that you bring home depends on your performance.
		  - You earn guaranteed prize after the 5th correct question.
		  - You earn guaranteed prize after the 10th correct question.
		  - You earn guaranteed prize after the 15th correct question.
